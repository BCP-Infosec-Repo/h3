## Description

h3 is a library and command line utility that is attempting to standardize information security skill assessment. Frankly, I don't know exactly what this is going to look like but I know it's something that's desparately needed in our field. The goals of this are to:

- Objectively score technical competency in many areas critical to information security work
- Provide rubrics to determine level of expertise in any given competency
- Enable professionals, mentors, and employers to recommend training based on deficiencies identified in the h3 model

## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/gen0cide/h3/cmd/h3
```

## Model & Scoring

Coming Soon
